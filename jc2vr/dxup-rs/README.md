# exvr fork
semi-modified version of [dxup](https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxup) to build with Rust and to give us a DLL we can inject to hijack a D3D10 game

# DXUP
## A D3D9 and D3D10 -> D3D11 Translation Layer

### Get [latest build here](https://git.froggi.es/joshua/dxup/pipelines) or [tagged builds here](https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxup/releases).

### What's the point?
 - The main reason is for [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk), a D3D11->Vulkan translation layer. I'm sure where you can see where this is going... (linux, wine stuff.)
 - You can use this if you're a lazy gamedev and want to get access to some D3D11 features by querying the interfaces (and get some extensions, coming soon!)
 - You write a D3D9Ex game and don't want to deal with sync and other issues for VR.
 - You write a D3D9 game and don't want to deal with D3D9Ex's pool changes and therefore can't get shared resources.

D3D10 support is now deprecated on Linux platforms and won't be installed with the script or the verb as DXVK now implements this.

### How do I use it?
In order to install DXUP, get a release from either the [releases](https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxup/releases) page (for versioned releases) or from the [build server](https://git.froggi.es/joshua/dxup/pipelines) if you want one built against the latest or a specific commit then run
```
export WINEPREFIX=/path/to/.wine-prefix
winetricks --force setup_dxup_d3d9.verb
```

### How do I build it?
**Simple (Linux Only):**
Use ``./package-release.sh master /your/target/directory --no-package`` to automagically.

**Advanced (Windows & Linux):**

You can use meson to build the DLLs:

Windows: ``meson --backend vs2017 --buildtype release build`` in a Visual Studio x86/x64 Command Prompt depending on the arch you wish to build.

Linux: ``meson --cross-file build-win64.txt --buildtype release --prefix /your/dxup/directory build.w64 `` and vice versa for each arch (change 64s to 32s.)
